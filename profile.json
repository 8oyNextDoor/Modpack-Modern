A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-06-08T18:25:55.263079Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1240154,"followers":3199,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"ULSumfl4","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.0 (Forge)","version_number":"6.0.0-forge","changelog":"- Update to Minecraft 1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-08T18:26:31.366709Z","downloads":28342,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"5c090bf8e882c0ccb9dcdb4afe712fa430e03a02","sha512":"e78ddd02cca0a4553eb135dbb3ec6cbc59200dd23febf3491d112c47a0b7e9fe2b97f97a3d43bb44d69f1a10aad01143dcd84dc575dfa5a9eaa315a3ec182b37"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/ULSumfl4/ferritecore-6.0.0-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.0-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":122786,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.0-forge.jar"},"mods\\notenoughanimations-forge-1.6.4-mc1.20.jar":{"sha512":"32624b2a345d4f4d53b3bf7efc5680f43df09f95d497075fc6d61c806cbd056d76f48e51f05c7e60c4b01885c3239daecb0292616bf39a7d7e0de1d29a76dba8","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"MPCX6s5C","slug":"not-enough-animations","project_type":"mod","team":"Eayl8ao3","title":"Not Enough Animations","description":"Bringing first-person animations to the third-person","body":"# Not Enough Animations \n\nThis mod brings a lot of missing third-person animations from the first-person or modifies them to be better representative to how they should look like or look like in the first-person.

Most users should enjoy improved RAM usage, FPS and TPS\n* Fixed many GTCE bugs (invisible blocks, infinite amps)\nImproved player experience and QoL. Example: Different stone types of ores don't clog player inventories\n* Completely reworked and improved fluid pipes and energy cables\n* New item pipe system with huge throughputs and configurable logistics\n* World generation improvements. Better performance, rebalanced ores. New virtual fluid veins for harvesting\n* New content integrated from Shadows of Greg, Gregicality, GT5 Unofficial, TecTech, Nomifactory, GT New Horizons, GT IMPACT and more\n* Fancy rendering effects including emissive textures and bloom\n* Content added at every single tier of the game. No stone left unturned, this is a completely different GregTech experience from GTCE\n\nAnd many, many, many more things...\n\n## Dev Q&A\n* [Todo-List](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTechCEu-1.19/issues/125) for potential contributors who are interested in this project\n* [Wiki](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTechCEu-1.19/wiki/Dev-Q&A) illustrates common questions and answers related to development\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/gregtech-ce-unofficial-701354865217110096) The project is also under continuous development with a new version 1.20.1 coming soon.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it. Use at your own

[Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-06-08T12:24:31.708544Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1644261,"followers":2804,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.8.8","1.8.9"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"374z4jcq","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.2-1.20 - Forge","version_number":"1.6.2-1.20","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Update to 1.20\r\n* Fix Ukrainian localization by @BurrConnie in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/104\r\n* Italian Translation by @TheBossMagnus in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/108\r\n* gradle: Fix executable bit by @5HT2 in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/112\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @BurrConnie made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/104\r\n* @TheBossMagnus made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/108\r\n* @5HT2 made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/112\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.2-1.19.4...1.6.2-1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-08T12:24:30.292495Z","downloads":43897,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"c958a821ba34e6550afd12eb95571585270ec038","sha512":"00c03643642a811d72d48a6a370efbe220753b3836ea4c040ee56495cc1566e75ca1c5cc9f834f99733757dc56eaed3c90fb4b0092adfa992314f1cc816a5919"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/374z4jcq/entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.jar","filename":"entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":60489,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.jar"}},"modrinth_update_version":null}
