It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can

Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n¬†","published":"2022-09-13T21:58:16.905418Z","updated":"2023-06-24T14:46:17.540175Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"optional","downloads":247928,"followers":659,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["aZZZrtpR","vJ00juj2","7ainrOrH","EglYgeMq","Kfbnfh5q","i0mERlxq","ZvRvG9JE","r6uVoUxU","fbaUxdx3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/5a8203e120985d11616614e11ad7b888997000d8.png"},"version":{"id":"fbaUxdx3","project_id":"QdG47OkI","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.14","version_number":"1.14","changelog":"1.20 fix. works for me","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-24T14:46:18.529195Z","downloads":10297,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a1ae3f750a323927508fcf9b6fe43deddefd6ac32687ade5d37283e93e178bdfa3629e719dbdedaf2717f317150f0f47f252ba75ab317663e89964ab7ed3d587","sha1":"f11c4d7010f9572bd2e2ed64c15e544816226e0b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/versions/fbaUxdx3/modelfix-1.14.jar","filename":"modelfix-1.14.jar","primary":true,"size":45182,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nq0CQj6q","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"modelfix-1.14.jard"},"mods\\entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.jar":{"sha512":"00c03643642a811d72d48a6a370efbe220753b3836ea4c040ee56495cc1566e75ca1c5cc9f834f99733757dc56eaed3c90fb4b0092adfa992314f1cc816a5919","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"NNAgCjsB","slug":"entityculling","project_type":"mod","team":"hLPrl6Gq","title":"Entity Culling","description":"Using async path-tracing to hide Block-/Entities that are not visible","body":"# EntityCulling\n\nUsing async path-tracing to skip rendering Block/Entities that are not visible. [Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-09-22T17:07:54.581205Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1814390,"followers":3017,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.8.8","1.8.9"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"374z4jcq","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":false,"name":"1.6.2-1.20 -

Voice chat not connected<br/>Voice chat not installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server.

I've bundled them in this mod.\n\nThis mod adds a bunch of optional tweaks to improve the Quality of Life during gameplay. Tweaks can be individually enabled or disabled and configured. Many of the tweaks are disabled by default, so make sure to enable the features you want for the most bestest experience possible.\n\n## Features\n\n### No Offhand Torch With Block\nThis option will refuse to place a torch if you're holding a block in your main hand. Because there's no way you intended to place a torch in that case. Something was just standing in the way of the spot you wanted to place that block in but the torch was fitting since it's smaller. Fixed it for ya.\n\n### No Offhand Torch With Empty Hand\nYou know that feeling when you're tired, try to open the chest but misclicked the block next to it? And of course you still had a torch in your offhand. And of course it placed it. And now you have to break it again. Ugh. This option only allows torches to be placed when your main hand is not empty. This can be enabled additionally to the above.\n\n### Offhand Torch With Tools Only\nThis is the option I consider best, but it changes vanilla behaviour too much to be the default. This will only allow placing torches from the offhand when you're holding a tool. No more accidental torch placement, ever again.\n\n### Do Not Use Last Torch\nThis option is useful when using dynamic lights such as OptiFine. The last torch in your offhand will not be placeable, so you always have a light to carry around with you secured.\n\n### Hide Own Effect Particles\nThis option will make your own potion effect particles a lot less obtrusive for your client. Other players will see them normally. No more annoying particles blocking your view.\n\n### Hide Offhand Item\nWill prevent the item in your offhand from rendering, in case you hate seeing the torch you're carrying on the left. This can be toggled by a keybind too, in case you only hate seeing your offhand item sometimes.\n\n### Hide Shield Unless Holding Weapon\nWill prevent shields from being rendered in your offhand unless you're holding a weapon. Specifically, it needs to be a sword or an axe with an attack damage value greater than 1.5 hearts. No, that wooden stick you're holding isn't a weapon.\n\n### Auto Climb Ladder\nI often make really long ladders down to my mine, and it's a pain having to hold down a key the whole time while climbing back up. With this tweak on, you will continue to climb upwards as long as you look upwards while on a ladder. That means you can type in chat and do other things without instantly falling back down and losing all of your progress on the long journey.\n\n### Disable Potion Shift\nPrevents the inventory from being shifted to the right when potion effects are active. You probably never noticed because NEI did it in 1.7.10 and now Quark does it in 1.10.2 and then there's also a mod called No Potion Shift that does it, but in case you have none of these, you now have this!\n\n### Toggle Off Step Assist\nThere's people who hate step assist, but sometimes those step-assist granting items add some other cool perks that we want. So this option lets you disable the step-assist part only. With optional keybind to toggle.\n\n### Master Volume Slider in Options Screen\nYes, the new volume settings screen is cool. But couldn't you have kept the Master Volume slider on the main settings screen as well? After years of research I have concluded that you can, so I added it back. Saved you a click.\n\n### Music Volume Slider in Options Screen\nMade up user studies have shown that the average player will much more frequently want to turn off the music than change the master volume, so our team of highly experienced quantum programmers have also brought the music slider back to the main settings screen\n\n![](https://blay09.net/files/brand/clienttweaks_settings.png)","published":"2022-06-14T18:20:46.900416Z","updated":"2023-09-27T06:47:04.151958Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":71292,"followers":175,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["T0tustVF","SoUkWRKx","fK62VmwY","IjPL1T1N","Mz7eeTEe","gN1XVFx6","rlQ7mQes","Fhy3pE8g","fxUm9n5z","C46Y48g4","EmDsfaiv","almeE46g","FKfK6YfH","onfW0a04","ofJ9s6y0","iM86WEvk","L3su862e","kiZkKw4d","3zMCvvSv","7Zzx91AW","gUwtFfmz","x2nEWOgf","OranQBcj","uSdTs5qr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vPNqo58Q/78a0ae61d366c770fd2c19dab595a045a2d0c106.png"},"version":{"id":"7Zzx91AW","project_id":"vPNqo58Q","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"11.1.0+forge-1.20","version_number":"11.1.0+forge-1.20","changelog":"- Updated to Minecraft 1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-14T10:30:27.975695Z","downloads":174,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"5995788c20ae1c9e24f68a2ff7479841b2d0dbb1a299f25ad2208ae54b4bcb3ab1b3a22403139c31470240877f42eba113d8c7b9e704831e8df63c35179d6dbc","sha1":"f46ab635dfb286443581a24d2162b4ab442dbf83"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vPNqo58Q/versions/7Zzx91AW/clienttweaks-forge-1.20-11.1.0.jar","filename":"clienttweaks-forge-1.20-11.1.0.jar","primary":true,"size":131209,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"MBAkmtvl","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"z3R7bsM3","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"clienttweaks-forge-1.20-11.1.0.jar"},"mods\\invhud.forge.1.20.1-3.4.18.jar":{"sha512":"54548c0a91c2a0051c6284720d11e0824ee80087b2694dede6dc30af9d5c63ae3531a28872eb0b43293bb320ca52ef0cbf27792bc753e0c9ad0c870b62679e53","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Inventory HUD+(Forge edition)","description":"This mod will show you\n\nyour inventory while playing.\n\nEnjoy!\n","authors":["DmitryLovin"],"version":"${file.jarVersion}","icon":"C:\\Users\\Dmitry\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\171a3b50a35b1821addd2984996d5fb21d47f194.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"invhud.forge.1.20.1-3.4.18.jar"},"mods\\ftb-quests-forge-2001.1.3.jar":{"sha512":"00a749fac08accc5c790a3fdf74ba8ea9e638240770dedf438eab19e672a9e8a9927e9159f7c86a50b38224e5afba70defd907a43ed2ba3d7444f2641041abff","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"FTB Quests","description":"Lets you easily create and play with quests\n","authors":["LatvianModder"],"version":"2001.1.3","icon":null,"project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"ftb-quests-forge-2001.1.3.jar"},"mods\\balm-forge-1.20-7.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"4ebfdae0b02888eb5aca57ff1e1b6d0400a80290171509546bdb527e8f37f60a0e95750544db9b8a01f46af1fe96c508009f2b0252da82fa7ad55886cc8515d5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"MBAkmtvl","slug":"balm","project_type":"mod","team":"c1tw4qzj","title":"Balm","description":"Abstraction Layer (but not really)‚Ñ¢ for Blay's multiplatform mods","body":"<p><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.patreon.com/blay09\"> <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/patreon.png\" alt=\"Become a Patron\" width=\"217\" height=\"51\" /> </a> <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/spacer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"21\" height=\"51\" /> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://twitter.com/BlayTheNinth\"> <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/twitter.png\" alt=\"Follow me on Twitter\" width=\"51\" height=\"51\" /> </a> <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://discord.gg/scGAfXC\"> <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/discord.png\" alt=\"Join our Discord\" width=\"51\" height=\"51\" /> </a> <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/spacer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"51\" /> </p>\n\n## What is this?\n\nAbstraction Layer (but not really)‚Ñ¢ for Blay's multiplatform mods. This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support. For Fabric it depends on Cloth Config, for Forge it will use the default Forge config system in the backend.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at [@BlayTheNinth](https://twitter.com/BlayTheNinth).","published":"2022-06-14T18:11:16.556742Z","updated":"2023-09-27T06:42:10.712952Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":247107,"followers":359,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["yIf5KdB1","C0Q1coDV","OxgGZ2zM","DIjNWWDQ","3FaeA4B3","pLCLIILr","KHoU8dQ1","U6WiexwY","KGco8pn9","3gG05xht","yCm0MvD8","bv4c7vz6","HaskpkVN","rLFLPShY","vtPaYjej","jLBnf4l1","i5Q1d7Pr","TQMftlzA","ZI4feWbU","SLR7Xv0p","AhzvhBQj","oqGuqpwK","DENsCzBf","nErKcTp9","xAQtenTo","1pxcbuZv","840UhUoL","9XoBRgjV","6X6csbpx","nFs2ZvOR","NhlpDRNn","zq3nXKQW","TbFmWuAA","O2nbMbp5","C60k8eYK","XYqAzGqP","XNus763a","qUWyGBdD","RAATKbAN","uATqqu4e","lRKNKP0w","ONL5pq9r","FDkt1ohj","o7IqP6Td","DAOUt1Jg","VYTPVkW0","RXK9iX99","wiayzjLV","rbUpGzGA","i8CwYuCi","I5betUED","NRF4uKO7","c1GjX2k1","Zq0Ko2UQ","d7a0S3hj","l551HLmO","BLkvfQ2x","CO57SmJl","ffUlrjOr","jdk8u9nq","x70MCuv3","sBs7NeXN","BJ0Uk3Di","fFosgnEu","qHXzOzUv","YL5MVHnr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"CO57SmJl","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"7.1.1+forge-1.20","version_number":"7.1.1+forge-1.20","changelog":"- Added context-aware keybindings support for Fabric\n- Added support for Amecs key modifiers, mainly to allow configurable bindings in Inventory Essentials\n- Added limited support for multiple key modifiers within supported mods (mainly Inventory Essentials)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-14T15:30:25.728341Z","downloads":491,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"aa342c486f290a26ba2c160e152037379a5a7842","sha512":"4ebfdae0b02888eb5aca57ff1e1b6d0400a80290171509546bdb527e8f37f60a0e95750544db9b8a01f46af1fe96c508009f2b0252da82fa7ad55886cc8515d5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/versions/CO57SmJl/balm-forge-1.20-7.1.1.jar","filename":"balm-forge-1.20-7.1.1.jar","primary":true,"size":338760,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"c1tw4qzj","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"fFosgnEu","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"7.1.4+forge-1.20.1","version_number":"7.1.4+forge-1.20.1","changelog":"- **Hotfix:** Fixed Crafting Tweaks keybindings preventing others from working on Fabric if Amecs is not installed\n- Hotfix: Fixed Inventory Essentials keybindings preventing others from working on Fabric if Amecs is not installed\n- Hotfix: Fixed crash on world creation when used with Essentials\n- Added context-aware keybindings support for Fabric\n- Added support for Amecs key modifiers, mainly to allow configurable bindings in Inventory Essentials\n- Added limited support for multiple key modifiers within supported mods (mainly Inventory Essentials)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-18T06:59:38.442163Z","downloads":5654,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"1858edcc3fc2b94069cd119a6a767eb6403ad227d0207c15126cecec66dae98d7adac316026665352e05759ba2d56c0cf98e4b3a0315cf482f891b5600e36e8b","sha1":"3fa93026c20415026911da7864951b232984e5fd"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/versions/fFosgnEu/balm-forge-1.20.1-7.1.4.jar","filename":"balm-forge-1.20.1-7.1.4.jar","primary":true,"size":339738,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"balm-forge-1.20-7.1.1.jar"},"mods\\open-parties-and-claims-forge-1.20.1-0.19.3.jar":{"sha512":"6b117f50a88cd87dd03e37b0c660b7e4353a59093a59c0b2d34de0d7b692a00fe91ca0a86e9cdbb46304ad0a06bc7a34007939d7ae2107bc84d61acc3f692773","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gF3BGWvG","slug":"open-parties-and-claims","project_type":"mod","team":"Byd3DEt2","title":"Open Parties and Claims","description":"Adds the ability to claim chunks and make player parties, integrates with Xaero's Minimap and World Map","body":"_**The mod is currently in Beta!**_\n\nThis mod adds the ability to claim and to forceload world chunks, as well as create and manage player parties. It also gives server owners powerful controls over their players' usage of the mod's features.\n\nThe mod's API allows other mods or plugins to easily interact with the parties and the chunk claims, both on the server and the client side. The mod already integrates with [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) and [World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map) mods. Make sure to update them to the latest versions.\n\nThe API of the mod allows the implementation of player permission systems to be used by the mod for some permission nodes (e.g. for having rank-based claim limits), with Prometheus, FTB Ranks, LuckPerms and the Forge/Fabric permission APIs having built-in support. It also allows the implementation of party systems to be used by claims alongside or instead of the default party system, with Argonauts and FTB Teams having built-in support. The default party system or claims can be disabled completely in the main config file.\n\n## Commands:\n/openpac ... - player config commands\n\n/openpac-claims ... - everything claim-related\n\n/openpac-parties ... - everything party-related\n\n/opm - shortcut for the party chat\n\n## Key Bindings:\n' - open the mod UI. Can be changed in the controls menu.\n\n## Configs:\n[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml - the main mod config. Make sure to shut down the server before editing it, or the server might overwrite all your changes.\n\n[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-... - some global \"player configs\", although all of them can be accessed in game through the UI\n\n## FAQ\n### 1) How do I configure the mod on my server?\nThe mod is mainly configured through the main config file at _[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_, while the server isn't running. Server claim, expired claim and wilderness configs, as well as the default player config, can be edited by OPs in-game with the UI (check your key bindings). Normal players can configure their own player config with the same UI. If the mod isn't installed on the client side, then you can use the player config chat commands instead.\n\n### 2) How do I use this mod as a regular player?\nMost things related to claims can be accessed with the in-game UI (check your key bindings). If you have the Xaero's World Map mod installed, you can view and edit your claims on the map screen as well, by right-clicking on the map or dragging with the right mouse button to make a selection. You can also use chat commands to make/edit claims. Parties can only be created and managed through chat commands at the moment.\n\n### 3) Why are some options greyed out in my player config?\nThe server admin/owner can configure with the main config file option _playerConfigurablePlayerConfigOptions_ which specific options players have access to. Everything else uses the value in the default player config.\n\n### 4) How do I disable all protection on my server?\nIn the server claim, expired claim and wilderness configs, as well as the default player config, disable the main protection option. Next, edit the config file _[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_, while the server isn't running. Remove the main option _claims.protectClaimedChunks_ from _playerConfigurablePlayerConfigOptions_.\n\n## Supported Mods:\nA lot of (usually smaller) mods should be supported by the claimed chunk protection automatically. Some mods go above and beyond with the mechanics they add to the game or modify, in which case chunk protection is not guaranteed and should be manually added, either to this mod or with an additional one. Feel free to leave suggestions on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/thexaero/open-parties-and-claims/issues) for the mods that you'd like to be supported. Please make sure that they are not already by testing it and provide an example of chunk griefing one can achieve with the mod.\n\nExplicitly supported mods:\n\n* (Since b0.8.0) Create - built into

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods (ImmersivePortals benefits a lot from this)\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!

General Notes\n\n* CraftPresence identifies as a **Client Side-only** mod\n    * This means it **will not run** on the Server's side.\n    * Fabric and Quilt mod loaders will simply ignore the\n      mod, while other mod loaders may crash.\n* Some versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.14.x and above require\n  the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)\n  and the [Fabric mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer)\n* Some versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.13.x require\n  the [Rift API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rift)\n  and the [Rift mod loader](https://github.com/DimensionalDevelopment/Rift/releases)\n* Versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.1.0 and below\n  require [Risugami's ModLoader](https://mcarchive.net/mods/modloader)\n\n## Features\n\nIn addition to having the ability to change your discord status from \"Playing Minecraft\",\nThis mod offers plenty of customization options to specify entirely how others see you play.\nFrom having your current biome show up, to which dimension your in, as well as which server you're in, and more.\nThe customization possibilities are limitless, with the only real limit being how creative you customize your display.\n\n### Launcher and Pack Integration Support\n\nCraftPresence will detect whether your Launch Directory contains:\n\n* A ATLauncher Instance (instance.json)\n* A valid Twitch/Overwolf/Curse/GDLauncher Manifest (manifest.json, minecraftinstance.json)\n* A MCUpdater Instance (instance.json)\n* A Modrinth Instance (profile.json)\n* A MultiMC Instance (instance.cfg)\n* A Technic installedPacks File (installedPacks)\n\nIf using any of these launchers, note the following:\n\n* Prior to v1.6.0, it'll put the packs name in your display as well as show its icon (when not in a\n  server)\n* From v1.6.0 until v2.0.0, it'll instead parse the Pack's name into the `&PACK&` placeholder, that you can configure\n  for\n  usage in the RPC\n* In v2.0, the pack's info is instead parsed into the `pack.name` and `pack.icon` placeholders, that you can configure\n  for\n  usage in the RPC\n\nAs an example, this is how the mod will convert a pack's name to an iconKey:\n\nExample: `All the Mods 7` would parse as `allthemods7`\n\nNote: MultiMC natively has an Icon Key Property that is used instead of converting from the Pack's Display Name\n\n## Commands\n\nCraftPresence currently offers the following Commands:\n\nKeep in mind the following:\n\n* Commands must be prefixed by either `/craftpresence` or `/cp`\n* In v1.5.0 and above, these commands are only usable via the Commands Gui, found within the Config Gui\n\n___\n\n* `/cp compile \"[expr]\"` - Test the output of a placeholder expression, via Starscript\n* `/cp search (type:typeName, [searchTerm], all)` - Search for valid placeholders available to use with Rich Presence\n* `/cp reload` - Reloads mod data\n* `/cp

- Displays all asset icon keys available to you\n    * `/cp view dimensions` - Displays all Dimension Names available for use, requires `Show Current Dimension` to be\n      enabled\n    * `/cp view biomes` - Displays all Biome Names available for use, requires `Show Current Biome` to be enabled\n    * `/cp view servers` - Displays all Server Addresses available for use, requires `Show Game

`/cp reboot`)\n* `/cp (help | ?)` - Help Command to display the above commands and these explanations\n\n## KeyBinds\n\nCraftPresence currently contains the following KeyBinds:\n\nNotes:\n\n* In v1.5.5 up to v1.8.0, KeyBinds are now customized in the Accessibility Settings in the Config Gui, and not the\n  normal controls menu\n* In v1.8.0 and above, KeyBinds can now be customized in either the dedicated menu in the Config Gui or the normal\n  control menu on applicable versions\n\n___\n\n* `Open Config Gui` - KeyBind to open the CraftPresence Config Gui (Default: GRAVE/TILDE Key)\n\n## About Placeholders and Functions\n\nIn some configuration areas, CraftPresence provides some placeholders and functions to make things easier:\n\nKeep in mind the following:\n\n* In v2.0.0, placeholders have been rewritten to be compatible\n  with [Starscript](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/starscript)\n    * The older list of this section can be\n      viewed [here](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/-/wikis/Legacy-Placeholders-(v1.x))\n    * All Placeholders, functions, and code expressions must be surrounded with curly brackets (Example: `{foo.bar}`)\n    * In the event that you need to combine a placeholder with other data in a function argument, use the `getResult`\n      function\n    * Additional functions and standard variables are available\n      within [StandardLib](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/starscript/wiki)\n\n___\n\n### Placeholder List\n\nThe following placeholders are available for use anywhere in

can hinder certain portions of the backend in addition to cause certain parts of the mod to not work.\n\nWith this in mind, please note the following:\n\n* **Minecraft 1.16 and above**\n    * As more parts of the game become data-driven, modded data is no longer able to be automatically retrieved without\n      first being in the world.\n    * So far, Biome and Dimension Modules are effected by this change and only display default data, with extra data\n      needing to be discovered first.\n* **Minecraft 1.15 and below**\n    * `MC-112292`: When interacting with the `RenderUtils#drawItemStack` method, used in the v2 Item Renderer, blocks\n      using certain renderers may fail to display properly.\n    * Additionally, on 1.15.x exclusively, z-level issues may occur on Screens using this method\n* **Minecraft a1.1.2_01 and below**\n    * On these versions, the Biome and Dimension Modules are **stubbed** with default data, due to the logic for these\n      methods being missing (Having been initially implemented in Alpha 1.2.6)\n* **Miscellaneous Issues**\n    * Due to obfuscation issues in earlier versions of Minecraft, the Biome and Dimension Modules may fail to\n      auto-detect some necessary information.\n        * As a fallback, the mod is also designed to add selectable Module Data when said biome/dimension is first\n          discovered.\n        * The \"Add New\" option found in some of the module lists can also be used to work around this issue.\n\nAdditionally, in select Minecraft Versions, the following config settings are effected:\n\n* `guiBackgroundColor` (`RenderUtils#DEFAULT_GUI_BACKGROUND`)\n    * MC 1.6 and above: `minecraft:textures/gui/options_background.png`\n    * MC 1.5.2 until a1.1.2_01: `/gui/background.png`\n    * MC a1.1.2_01 and below: `/dirt.png`\n* `stripTranslationColors` (`ModUtils#IS_TEXT_COLORS_BLOCKED`)\n    * This option is forcefully disabled on MC 1.1.0 and below due to various issues regarding TextColor usage,\n      including possible crashes\n    * This change is also auto-applied to existing configs trying to bypass this, unlike the background colors, since\n      resource packs can re-implement those textures\n\n### Icon Requesting\n\nNot seeing an Icon you like or have a suggestion for an Icon to add/modify on the default Client ID?\n\nIf so, you can make a request on my [Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/issues/), with the\nfollowing requirements:\n\n* If adding an Icon from a dimension, specify the Mod's link that the dimension derives from\n    * This is because specific Icon IDs must be used, which can be found by the mod or from checking your Logs/Chat\n      after entering the dimension as CraftPresence will tell you the ID expected\n* An Icon of size between `512x512` and `1024x1024` to be used (Either minimum or recommended size for best quality)\n    * Icons between these sizes can be used, but may not give a great final quality\n* If requesting an icon to be modified or removed from the Default Client ID, please specify a reason why\n    * Mostly just so it can be logged why it was changed for future reference\n\nAdditionally, you can also create your own Set of Icons by\nfollowing [this guide](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/-/wikis/Making-your-Own-Client-ID-+-Using-your-own-Images)\n\n### Support\n\nNeed some assistance with one of my mods or wish to provide

v2.2.3 (1.20.1)","version_number":"2.2.3+1.20.1","changelog":"# CraftPresence Changes\n\n## v2.2.3 (09/14/2023)\n\n_A Detailed Changelog from the last release is\navailable [here](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/-/compare/release%2Fv2.2.2...release%2Fv2.2.3)_\n\nSee the Mod Description or [README](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence) for more info regarding the mod.\n\n### Fixes\n\n* Backend: Fixed exceptions in `FileUtils#filesInDir` that were not being ignored correctly\n    * This was previously resolved in v2.2.2 for BTA 1.7.7.0_02\n    * BTAs 1.7.7.0_01 build does not contain this fix\n\n___\n\n### More Information\n\n#### Known Issues\n\nDespite configuration compatibility being ensured between v1.8.x/v1.9.x and v2.0,\ncaution is advised to ensure the best experience, while also baring in mind that features can be adjusted, removed, or\nadded/iterated upon between releases.\n\nThe following known issues are present in this build:\n\n* On certain MC versions, Scrolling while in a Scroll List drawing `ItemStack`'s may cause GUI distortions\n* Text with colors do not retain those colors if that text moves to a newline in the CraftPresence UIs\n* The HypherionMC Config Layer (To Convert a Simple RPC config to CraftPresence) contains the following known issues:\n    * Placeholders related to the realm event are currently unimplemented and parse as `{''}`.\n\n#### Snapshot Build Info\n\nSome Versions of this Mod are for Minecraft Snapshots or Experimental Versions, and as such, caution should be noted.\n\nAny

(Forge)","description":"Rewrites the light engine to fix lighting performance and lighting errors","body":"Starlight\n==================\nForge mod for rewriting the light engine to fix lighting performance and lighting errors.\n\nMinecraft 1.20 Light engine changes\n------------------\nPlease see: https://gist.github.com/Spottedleaf/6cc1acdd03a9b7ac34699bf5e8f1b85c\nTL;DR\nMojang improved upon their own light engine using the same performance critical designs from Starlight. As a result, they have closed the performance gap, obsoleting Starlight on the client side.\n\nCompatibility\n------------------\nStarlight can be installed either on the dedicated server or client. It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20. Starlight and Vanilla are close enough on 1.20 that\nthis test is also useless.\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/ZQx7Ek0.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/MrA2PQk.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")\n\nPerformance for 1.19.4 and below:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 3 critical areas: Chunk generation, Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n![Light engine time chunk generation Graph](https://i.imgur.com/5aI8Eaf.png \"Light engine time chunk generation Graph\")\n![Block update at height graph](https://i.imgur.com/kKtbe9y.png \"Block update at height graph\")\n![Simple glowstone block update](https://i.imgur.com/yCNK602.png \"Simple glowstone block update\")","published":"2021-09-12T18:30:52.613317Z","updated":"2023-07-08T06:10:53.576572Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":56113,"followers":135,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["RcAkwRce","QDfK5kGC","6n1Cz7ld","5aMZMK7v","eUgPCLKt","cNa0vkNj"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com//data/iRfIGC1s/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"cNa0vkNj","project_id":"iRfIGC1s","author_id":"fYyU5YhM","featured":true,"name":"Starlight 1.1.2 1.20 - 1.20.1 (Forge)","version_number":"1.1.2+1.20","changelog":"Update to 1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-08T06:10:54.244596Z","downloads":7057,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"cc89c6b2dd0db709586028c7732a57a3e6184f19cc2b98b25964c720c3ab434031e62de23e0dab022575d637b5e4a34b5813164d32ec356d56588da400e7d026","sha1":"a915880c7834a0b0f9f300f0e3053deaa9a3205a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/iRfIGC1s/versions/cNa0vkNj/starlight-1.1.2%2Bforge.1cda73c.jar","filename":"starlight-1.1.2+forge.1cda73c.jar","primary":true,"size":110583,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"st6zzqkJ","user":{"id":"fYyU5YhM","username":"spottedleaf","name":"Spottedleaf","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6100722?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-08-29T13:50:25.716250Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"starlight-1.1.2+forge.1cda73c.jard"},"mods\\appliedenergistics2-forge-15.0.11.jar":{"sha512":"2b47f03016abcbcc099293e51208cff8348334e04e4c91052152320108923713015ef20eab88f0d0c9b25874f851863f5b8463ca512810d7034cb87f17bfebb5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"XxWD5pD3","slug":"ae2","project_type":"mod","team":"CqWdb4w5","title":"Applied Energistics 2","description":"AE2: A popular automation and storage mod","body":"Applied Energistics 2 (AE2) is a comprehensive mod for Minecraft that introduces a unique approach to in-game inventory management. It presents a tech-based, futuristic theme, centered around the concept of using energy and technology to convert matter into energy and vice versa. Please come visit our [homepage](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne).\n\n![image of subnetworks from the guidebook](https://guide-assets.appliedenergistics.org/minecraft-1.20.1/ae2/ae2-mechanics/subnetworks_scene1.njRxulYCJ84v.png)\n\nKey features of the mod include:\n\n**Storage Systems**: AE2 revolutionizes storage in Minecraft. The mod adds a network-based digital storage system, where items and blocks are stored as energy in a digital form within a network of connected devices. This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items.\n\n**Auto-Crafting**: Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort.\n\n**Networking and Channels**: AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system. Devices connected to the same network can communicate and interact with each other, and the channel system limits the number of devices that can be connected to a single cable, adding a layer of planning and organization to your builds.\n\n**Spatial Storage**: This feature allows players to store entire regions of space within a spatial storage cell. Essentially, you can take a chunk of the world, including all blocks, items, and entities within, and store it digitally to be released later.\n\n**Unique Resources**: AE2 introduces several new resources and materials for crafting its technological components, such as Certus Quartz, Fluix Crystals, and Inscribers. Many of these new materials come with their own decorative blocks to spice up your builds.\n\nAE2 is known for the complexity and depth it adds to Minecraft's tech gameplay, encouraging players to create, optimize, and manage large-scale, efficient systems. It is a fantastic mod for those who love to automate processes and manage resources efficiently.","published":"2021-12-14T11:50:43.324146Z","updated":"2023-10-01T17:24:34.574101Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":167357,"followers":335,"categories":["storage","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["OqkivEmV","DZZbZnbH","cLm6eoS7","Bf4qfsQf","6AN4WLgf","n6ctl28A","ePPHPjw7","EkIUZgzp","uWZo3axN","kOb7LSAK","pRtKJO4l","2TIYWbvo","aUAC5DXB","mlkfFOT9","Q6LSGEqw","f0cVzJbq","xKkeaqkM","2OY506tW","LmtoNQhm","Ieppgyii","XSv7aCzj","7rSpITeE","Z32dIodF","fMM2pwnM","Woty8glY","NFcpTG3k","W5IItIBw","xDGpy4Qn","ByV6cOMZ","nZG3f7mn","697yLiPU","fjroW9SS","BF8g0TZ3","sWmGENVC","qosXJAjq","OiY2lfg0","3FuIT2JI","5KhL4WhW","RWto5Lhw","wHN8x90L","sm5CvPw0","oMLKu1Ze","nuYdiTZB","oLeqpmhw","mV6fTxoi","kOcIph1U","HJrR1zgA","JSwFZQ02","aR5tGCcS","s3g4KtWI","enxs5scj","9WXP1AHX","mv6YbdV3","7Gq3qbtw","bD9ZXRfC","7UmbOb4g","WVYkyvRH","bpkm2yMw","C5nwXELu","ZaNpnMCh","OFBWYrp4","PvPdRUHX","PDkmB4UV","zkC0WSUn","Z6jnGDF9","5xa1OSzf","5EyIPVWA","XVFb5sJ7","WzDBx3u7","YNFx3Hjn","nrq8eC4Q","6VmOchNB","9XtLETKp","hCIvVRgg","RFmdcgz3","vrdekdmw","Z8OKgUoh","P4SHVMac","25KjhlGv","S3K8G49B","6qQEQmM8","36EMfB3q","DZd4yQe4","c3zEVaQ8","wYymrhE4","8HeKobcP","yz68xU3j","pcHc3tZs","MrXpPIvo","aszqg0Wn","WAh5HPC8","RgkwNSjT","62yssi1E","A5FUIGjh","q5TQ3zgd","9P35YnKN","ix3GcoBP","RJnK9Ovj","MoGLgJK1","t3aUE6HS","7NWAte1m","PWdOzVug","HQd68kb6","lp2vAcHP","c0KKkf1Z","zhr2jXaL","9evKVcVd","MPdVG6oo","COSdQAoF","TBVf9h2p","CKA0xF7f","GL3uhBGD","brl6VeNy","TMEAMYIx","g7uJnOOS","sALiGsl3","yIupDKor","oAGWsu3M","JRLfd73N","UAuf0uiD","3Mvq6QHo","L6VGYHd3","y5W8KGqT","xGjt6qMm","sOqmy2ww","COba8tGt","8C4WbuoI","NX3fAZif","DsTIvcA1","Tw8kyhfI","NHcKcc8c","Xc1WEGPd","1HKx8M9v","qf2Yz73T","8HEK7sk8","ijZQY1Rd","xzP4cydc","a5pC6xdL","QalOLGBM","RpMpf7zi","Zrp3c9yN","7vB6vk2v","7ACUdipn","Sz6f1zJd","qfpQmwll","lePuKDdy","TKhjxSIB","oS3Ga2mY","7j0MvcB1","IcREcVDb","Mdn0ka1O","AxEi5RIz","b13bPfeM","rLjoLUTF","wGIGpPsQ","tifFqBKk","W4efZESl","lThI0ayT","qBbqV301","l3tOwBzj","LxjXwNSj","Bj8oQseU","IWm9cQdw","CkK2zzkf","xUoHYNEg","5cb16tgY","HAKkYcmv","1kT0YXJf"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XxWD5pD3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"5cb16tgY","project_id":"XxWD5pD3","author_id":"3HAu37Rl","featured":false,"name":"AE2

In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, there is no official way to do that. Copying cache from a singleplayer map will not work.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page.

This will explain the absence of updates. Why again? It's just not fun anymore and I am always worried about once again being embedded in annoying discord drama that somehow manages to suck every bit of enjoyment out of modding. There hasn't been anyone willing to step up and take over development and that's partly my fault. This notice is months late. If you enjoy fastload and intend to maintain it, just contact me on discord for a discussion. Please keep in mind that I won't respond quickly because I don't really use discord much at all anymore. Thank you for taking your time to read this!\n\n# Short explanation\nFastload is a *relatively* simple mod that changes some crucial parts of world loading to speed it up.\n\n# Environments\n- Client (Optional)\n- Server (Optional)\n\n# Credits\n- StockiesLad (Owner)\n- JoostMSoftware (Co-Owner)\n- AbdElAziz333 (Forge)\n- VidTu (Ksyxis (Idea))\n- kennytv (Forcecloseloadingscreen (Code))\n\n# Features\n- 441 Pre-generator: Entirely yanks it to sync chunk generation with chunk rendering.\n- Loading Screens: Cancellable (Configurable)\n- Rendering: Pre-rendering Phase (Configurable)\n\n# Suggested With\n- C2ME: Optimises chunk generation.\n- Sodium: Optimises chunk rendering.\n\n# Explanation\nThe 441 chunk loading engine is pretty much what the name is. The reason for it being 441 chunks is that\nit generates chunks in a 10 chunk radius as a square. So multiply that by 2, add 1 (because you are standing\non a chunk) and square it. Fastload removes this *feature* as it is a huge waste of time. Instead, it will\nonly load 1 chunk (the spawn chunk) and loads the rest of the spawn region during early rendering.\n\nAlong with that, it also replaces some of the loading screens with its own implementation. This pretty much\nallows rendering to begin immediately instead of it being halted until the player spawn packet is received.\n\n# Links\n- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload\n- Curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastload\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/fMSnenNSXM\n\n","published":"2022-06-04T16:09:02.891982Z","updated":"2023-08-15T12:36:53.077035Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":538829,"followers":1023,"categories":["optimization","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["OAv8CrM0","hR5aj90D","Lbph3YVy","nkXCDjTX","CVP8s8T3","tFMofdbs","3j5R1tqr","opd0zx0e","iiKA1DWl","DVbkQeRT","bAEd4DsW","PjaIK1Vp","tAJHf9G7","wIStpaL0","8J8D4v6o","1wIMDix7","BnPn5A62","f4sYhmcE","meWCSzii","DJkYeZd5","1f1DA0KB","QNff3l3l","QlIwIIh9","C2LwOzJk","1uyZI4Sv","FKmzXNtY","K88McHch","DQlQxhhM","qIDVvUbg","nAfxWveV","MmygcB2M","zNe7bwry","Tv3wOvtj","ksl46t40","qkR1zzal","dKaZj3NX","bxgfNPxE","LtO049ip","RWontocM","tMBTPH4j","rGmamzE5","gdXi90uO","Dsgo7CSj","2Yda0wxa","pPHZxvSq","mBNst1pT","NHYFVTEV","WyunD6Js","N1SrNeBH","IpZXHH55","rxKwFSer","ZlGXwJvh","TQqs51tn","DadZpSjE","tMPV3Kkg","ZF0uERgW","FpDn2R2L","gIRDVsr1","a5IjqNvz","DlCLRU3a","WU1it2AO","FU50wLzH","DhZ4Ja4S","Y0vyVBp6","suyTpHDo","gO58JOqR","K9vr5fdy","OQyAqgWH","AWGFfzNY","Jy0nBwT7","n2GBDiY8","YvKzIdFE","lbg7lLOP","XzqjhWvy","GCH0zDV1","cOIVKLwU","FswsA1ru","pDTCLzgm","s3zsS0HW","tykaPrWr","ILYiaB6n","jbjSMJqM","JpRTQ4PR","vD6ndABa","WryJ0FUZ","FcFh2FAO","PB8AbQO3","BwDnLgzN","OxwM6hRt","u4FVRRGd","ys9T20o4","47qpvpOP","P17HkM27","9Kgnmrza","3cboK7gk","HDvAnQIw","Z8CqLDDO","nHeyxX0A","fbLmfqa5","ka9OYmub","5caSj7kt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/47742fe96d19cdad9a3eb6a73bd9c7c1547fb4ad.png"},"version":{"id":"5caSj7kt","project_id":"kCpssoSb","author_id":"3AXCrCqA","featured":false,"name":"Fastload 3.4.0 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"mc1.20.1-3.4.0","changelog":"bump version.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-15T12:36:55.631401Z","downloads":8842,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"27d58f123951e0404c94caf16ff9b96b442f371c","sha512":"b8be6ed0bef707c7c34d84049eb68313a5c787f6e9c9a88fb94daed6bccfedc6c181a1fca431f53b6e8ac03c7baf7653414b5a5792cab6b500c6d66502489431"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/kCpssoSb/versions/5caSj7kt/Fastload-Reforged-mc1.20.1-3.4.0.jar","filename":"Fastload-Reforged-mc1.20.1-3.4.0.jar","primary":true,"size":66989,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"3AXCrCqA","username":"AbdElAziz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89092953?v=4","bio":"I love all people","created":"2022-05-27T22:49:23.800376Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"6RqzXTwc","username":"StockiesLad","name":"Fluffy Bumblebee","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60066663?v=4","bio":"A lad from stockies mate.","created":"2022-06-04T16:04:13.709905Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"MGCy93QI","user":{"id":"GIn4UWLW","username":"JoostMSoftware","name":"Joost","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80041873?v=4","bio":"I'm a student Software Engineer that codes websites and mods for games.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

Do not report issues encountered with it to their bug tracker or in their Discord. I have my own [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) for my mods if you would like to discuss, provide suggestions, etc.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nGenerally Embeddium should work out of the box with many more mods than Rubidium. However, given the scope of changes\nit makes to the renderer, it may have compatibility issues with some mods that use advanced rendering. Please open an\nissue if you experience problems. Some issues may require changes to be made in the other mod but it's good to have\nthem documented.\n\nThe [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/wiki/Compatibility#known-incompatibilities) has a somewhat-maintained list of known incompatibilities.\n\n**OptiFine is not supported** for obvious reasons.\n\n## Shaders\n\nFor now, please continue to use [Oculus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus) if you want shader support.\nNote that Oculus is somewhat buggy, and your experience will probably be more stable without it. I recommend removing\nOculus if you do not need shaders.\n\n## Credits\n\n* JellySquid & the CaffeineMC team, for making Sodium in the first place, without which this project would not be possible\n* Asek3, for the initial port to Forge\n* XFactHD, for providing a list of gamebreaking Rubidium issues to start this work off, and for testing early builds\n* Pepper, for their invaluable assistance with getting Forge lighting to work on Sodium 0.5\n\n## License\n\nPlease refer to the [LICENSE](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/blob/16.x/forge/LICENSE) file.

It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen. You can even shift it by 1 pixel if you so wish. Can be useful when playing with other UI mods.</li>\n<li>2 block color modes:&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Vanilla</strong>, which uses the colors of vanilla Minecraft maps and&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Accurate</strong>, which uses the colors of block textures and biomes. You can also enable biome colors for the Vanilla mode using a separate setting.</li>\n<li>A custom key binding (Z by default) to temporarily enlarge the minimap to take a better look around.&nbsp;<strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.&nbsp;</strong>There are also settings for controlling the behavior of the minimap when it is enlarged, for example to center the minimap on the screen or to fully zoom out the minimap.</li>\n<li>Map shading customization with the \"Terrain Depth\" and \"Terrain Slopes\" settings.</li>\n<li>Compatible with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's World Map</a>. By default uses the map textures generated by the world map mod instead of generating its own. This improves performance when using both mods.</li>\n<li>Option to limit your minimap access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets. Your current set can be quickly switched with a key binding. <strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sharing</strong>. You can share your waypoints in the game chat with players on the server. This is done from the waypoints list (press U).</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Deathpoints</strong>. An&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">automatic skull-shaped waypoint</strong>&nbsp;is created&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">on each death</strong>. Old deathpoints are converted to regular waypoints, which you can disable using the \"Keep Old Deathpoints\" setting.</li>\n<li>Displays chunk claims and ally players from the <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Parties and Claims</a> mod.</li>\n<li>Togglable&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">chunk grid</strong>.

The chunks where slimes can spawn are marked with a green overlay.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom light overlay</strong>. You can setup a light overlay that will mark blocks with a custom color if they are within a custom light value range, which is block light from 0 to 7 by default. The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\". You can do it through the <em>Waypoints Menu (press U) -&gt; Options</em> screen.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mobs</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">yellow dots.</strong>&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Hostile and friendly</strong>&nbsp;mobs can be colored&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">differently. </strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">players</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">white dots or player heads.&nbsp;</strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">items</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">red dots. </strong>Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays all the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">other entities</strong>&nbsp;such as arrows and item frames as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">purple dots</strong><span class=\"bbc\">.</span><strong class=\"bbc\">&nbsp;</strong>Different types of entities can be disabled in the settings.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Options for <strong>displaying entity names </strong>on the minimap<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in the \"Entity Radar\" settings.</li>\n<li>Zoom in and out key bindings&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">(I and O by default) </strong>to efficiently change the zoom level to fit your preference or use case.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Coordinates&nbsp;</strong>under the minimap.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Current biome name</strong>&nbsp;under the minimap.

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## üêõ Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## üéÅ How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ‚ùì What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## üñ•Ô∏è Need a server?
