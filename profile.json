Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

recipes, add new custom items, script world events, all in JavaScript!","body":"# KubeJS\n\n---\n\n## What does this mod do?\nThis mod lets you create scripts in JavaScript language to manage your server, add new blocks and items, change recipes and tags, add custom handlers for quest mods, change worldgen and more!\n\n## How to use it?\nRun the game with mod installed once. It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can report issues on [Here](https://kubejs.com/support?source=kubejs).\n\n## I have more questions/suggestions!\nIf wiki didn't have the answer for what you were looking for, you can join the [Discord

versions of minecraft, e.g. raw ores, datapack for recipes and ore/fluid veins\n* Better performance makes later stages of GregTheh smoother\n* New textures, UI, built-in CTM\n* No need to install dependencies\n* More customization capabilities, custom UIs, custom machines, multiblocks, etc\n\n## A (very, VERY) brief list of some new features (from GTCEu):\n\n* Greatly improved performance and optimization from GTCE. Most users should enjoy improved RAM usage, FPS and TPS\n* Fixed many GTCE bugs (invisible blocks, infinite amps)\nImproved player experience and QoL. Example: Different stone types of ores don't clog player inventories\n* Completely reworked and improved fluid pipes and energy cables\n* New item pipe system with huge throughputs and configurable logistics\n* World generation improvements. Better performance, rebalanced ores. New virtual fluid veins for harvesting\n* New content integrated from Shadows of Greg, Gregicality, GT5 Unofficial, TecTech, Nomifactory, GT New Horizons, GT IMPACT and more\n* Fancy rendering effects including emissive textures and bloom\n* Content added at every single tier of the game. No stone left unturned, this is a completely different GregTech experience from GTCE\n\nAnd many, many, many more things...\n\n## Dev Q&A\n* [Todo-List](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTechCEu-1.19/issues/125) for potential contributors who are interested in this project\n* [Wiki](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTechCEu-1.19/wiki/Dev-Q&A) illustrates common questions and answers related to development\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/gregtech-ce-unofficial-701354865217110096) The project is also under continuous development with a new version 1.20.1 coming soon.

General Notes\n\n* CraftPresence identifies as a **Client Side-only** mod\n    * This means it **will not run** on the Server's side.\n    * Fabric and Quilt mod loaders will simply ignore the\n      mod, while other mod loaders may crash.\n* Some versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.14.x and above require\n  the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)\n  and the [Fabric mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer)\n* Some versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.13.x require\n  the [Rift API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rift)\n  and the [Rift mod loader](https://github.com/DimensionalDevelopment/Rift/releases)\n* Versions of CraftPresence for Minecraft 1.1.0 and below\n  require [Risugami's ModLoader](https://mcarchive.net/mods/modloader)\n\n## Features\n\nIn addition to having the ability to change your discord status from \"Playing Minecraft\",\nThis mod offers plenty of customization options to specify entirely how others see you play.\nFrom having your current biome show up, to which dimension your in, as well as which server you're in, and more.\nThe customization possibilities are limitless, with the only real limit being how creative you customize your display.\n\n### Launcher and Pack Integration Support\n\nCraftPresence will detect whether your Launch Directory contains:\n\n* A ATLauncher Instance (instance.json)\n* A valid Twitch/Overwolf/Curse/GDLauncher Manifest (manifest.json, minecraftinstance.json)\n* A MCUpdater Instance (instance.json)\n* A Modrinth Instance (profile.json)\n* A MultiMC Instance (instance.cfg)\n* A Technic installedPacks File (installedPacks)\n\nIf using any of these launchers, note the following:\n\n* Prior to v1.6.0, it'll put the packs name in your display as well as show its icon (when not in a\n  server)\n* From v1.6.0 until v2.0.0, it'll instead parse the Pack's name into the `&PACK&` placeholder, that you can configure\n  for\n  usage in the RPC\n* In v2.0, the pack's info is instead parsed into the `pack.name` and `pack.icon` placeholders, that you can configure\n  for\n  usage in the RPC\n\nAs an example, this is how the mod will convert a pack's name to an iconKey:\n\nExample: `All the Mods 7` would parse as `allthemods7`\n\nNote: MultiMC natively has an Icon Key Property that is used instead of converting from the Pack's Display Name\n\n## Commands\n\nCraftPresence currently offers the following Commands:\n\nKeep in mind the following:\n\n* Commands must be prefixed by either `/craftpresence` or `/cp`\n* In v1.5.0 and above, these commands are only usable via the Commands Gui, found within the Config Gui\n\n___\n\n* `/cp compile \"[expr]\"` - Test the output of a placeholder expression, via Starscript\n* `/cp search (type:typeName, [searchTerm], all)` - Search for valid placeholders available to use with Rich Presence\n* `/cp reload` - Reloads mod data\n* `/cp

- Displays all asset icon keys available to you\n    * `/cp view dimensions` - Displays all Dimension Names available for use, requires `Show Current Dimension` to be\n      enabled\n    * `/cp view biomes` - Displays all Biome Names available for use, requires `Show Current Biome` to be enabled\n    * `/cp view servers` - Displays all Server Addresses available for use, requires `Show Game

`/cp reboot`)\n* `/cp (help | ?)` - Help Command to display the above commands and these explanations\n\n## KeyBinds\n\nCraftPresence currently contains the following KeyBinds:\n\nNotes:\n\n* In v1.5.5 up to v1.8.0, KeyBinds are now customized in the Accessibility Settings in the Config Gui, and not the\n  normal controls menu\n* In v1.8.0 and above, KeyBinds can now be customized in either the dedicated menu in the Config Gui or the normal\n  control menu on applicable versions\n\n___\n\n* `Open Config Gui` - KeyBind to open the CraftPresence Config Gui (Default: GRAVE/TILDE Key)\n\n## About Placeholders and Functions\n\nIn some configuration areas, CraftPresence provides some placeholders and functions to make things easier:\n\nKeep in mind the following:\n\n* In v2.0.0, placeholders have been rewritten to be compatible\n  with [Starscript](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/starscript)\n    * The older list of this section can be\n      viewed [here](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/-/wikis/Legacy-Placeholders-(v1.x))\n    * All Placeholders, functions, and code expressions must be surrounded with curly brackets (Example: `{foo.bar}`)\n    * In the event that you need to combine a placeholder with other data in a function argument, use the `getResult`\n      function\n    * Additional functions and standard variables are available\n      within [StandardLib](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/starscript/wiki)\n\n___\n\n### Placeholder List\n\nThe following placeholders are available for use anywhere in

can hinder certain portions of the backend in addition to cause certain parts of the mod to not work.\n\nWith this in mind, please note the following:\n\n* **Minecraft 1.16 and above**\n    * As more parts of the game become data-driven, modded data is no longer able to be automatically retrieved without\n      first being in the world.\n    * So far, Biome and Dimension Modules are effected by this change and only display default data, with extra data\n      needing to be discovered first.\n* **Minecraft 1.15 and below**\n    * `MC-112292`: When interacting with the `RenderUtils#drawItemStack` method, used in the v2 Item Renderer, blocks\n      using certain renderers may fail to display properly.\n    * Additionally, on 1.15.x exclusively, z-level issues may occur on Screens using this method\n* **Minecraft a1.1.2_01 and below**\n    * On these versions, the Biome and Dimension Modules are **stubbed** with default data, due to the logic for these\n      methods being missing (Having been initially implemented in Alpha 1.2.6)\n* **Miscellaneous Issues**\n    * Due to obfuscation issues in earlier versions of Minecraft, the Biome and Dimension Modules may fail to\n      auto-detect some necessary information.\n        * As a fallback, the mod is also designed to add selectable Module Data when said biome/dimension is first\n          discovered.\n        * The \"Add New\" option found in some of the module lists can also be used to work around this issue.\n\nAdditionally, in select Minecraft Versions, the following config settings are effected:\n\n* `guiBackgroundColor` (`RenderUtils#DEFAULT_GUI_BACKGROUND`)\n    * MC 1.6 and above: `minecraft:textures/gui/options_background.png`\n    * MC 1.5.2 until a1.1.2_01: `/gui/background.png`\n    * MC a1.1.2_01 and below: `/dirt.png`\n* `stripTranslationColors` (`ModUtils#IS_TEXT_COLORS_BLOCKED`)\n    * This option is forcefully disabled on MC 1.1.0 and below due to various issues regarding TextColor usage,\n      including possible crashes\n    * This change is also auto-applied to existing configs trying to bypass this, unlike the background colors, since\n      resource packs can re-implement those textures\n\n### Icon Requesting\n\nNot seeing an Icon you like or have a suggestion for an Icon to add/modify on the default Client ID?\n\nIf so, you can make a request on my [Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/issues/), with the\nfollowing requirements:\n\n* If adding an Icon from a dimension, specify the Mod's link that the dimension derives from\n    * This is because specific Icon IDs must be used, which can be found by the mod or from checking your Logs/Chat\n      after entering the dimension as CraftPresence will tell you the ID expected\n* An Icon of size between `512x512` and `1024x1024` to be used (Either minimum or recommended size for best quality)\n    * Icons between these sizes can be used, but may not give a great final quality\n* If requesting an icon to be modified or removed from the Default Client ID, please specify a reason why\n    * Mostly just so it can be logged why it was changed for future reference\n\nAdditionally, you can also create your own Set of Icons by\nfollowing [this guide](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/-/wikis/Making-your-Own-Client-ID-+-Using-your-own-Images)\n\n### Support\n\nNeed some assistance with one of my mods or wish to provide

v2.2.3 (1.20.1)","version_number":"2.2.3+1.20.1","changelog":"# CraftPresence Changes\n\n## v2.2.3 (09/14/2023)\n\n_A Detailed Changelog from the last release is\navailable [here](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence/-/compare/release%2Fv2.2.2...release%2Fv2.2.3)_\n\nSee the Mod Description or [README](https://gitlab.com/CDAGaming/CraftPresence) for more info regarding the mod.\n\n### Fixes\n\n* Backend: Fixed exceptions in `FileUtils#filesInDir` that were not being ignored correctly\n    * This was previously resolved in v2.2.2 for BTA 1.7.7.0_02\n    * BTAs 1.7.7.0_01 build does not contain this fix\n\n___\n\n### More Information\n\n#### Known Issues\n\nDespite configuration compatibility being ensured between v1.8.x/v1.9.x and v2.0,\ncaution is advised to ensure the best experience, while also baring in mind that features can be adjusted, removed, or\nadded/iterated upon between releases.\n\nThe following known issues are present in this build:\n\n* On certain MC versions, Scrolling while in a Scroll List drawing `ItemStack`'s may cause GUI distortions\n* Text with colors do not retain those colors if that text moves to a newline in the CraftPresence UIs\n* The HypherionMC Config Layer (To Convert a Simple RPC config to CraftPresence) contains the following known issues:\n    * Placeholders related to the realm event are currently unimplemented and parse as `{''}`.\n\n#### Snapshot Build Info\n\nSome Versions of this Mod are for Minecraft Snapshots or Experimental Versions, and as such, caution should be noted.\n\nAny

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-06-08T18:25:55.263079Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1240154,"followers":3199,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"ULSumfl4","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.0 (Forge)","version_number":"6.0.0-forge","changelog":"- Update to Minecraft 1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-08T18:26:31.366709Z","downloads":28342,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"5c090bf8e882c0ccb9dcdb4afe712fa430e03a02","sha512":"e78ddd02cca0a4553eb135dbb3ec6cbc59200dd23febf3491d112c47a0b7e9fe2b97f97a3d43bb44d69f1a10aad01143dcd84dc575dfa5a9eaa315a3ec182b37"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/ULSumfl4/ferritecore-6.0.0-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.0-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":122786,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.0-forge.jar"},"mods\\JadeAddons-1.20.1-forge-5.2.0.jar":{"sha512":"3f8497c632a36a223b2cfeba667d567085d9a552d2bb3be50c186798bf0bf88357bc66e5421baba8337502b1ad154d5d27949d4439808c58e7f95483489e2e7a","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"xuDOzCLy","slug":"jade-addons-forge","project_type":"mod","team":"hJTJq4KT","title":"Jade Addons (Forge)","description":"Jade 🔍's additional mod supports for Forge","body":"# Jade Addons (Forge)\n\nThis mod adds mod integration for [Jade 🔍](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade) 1.18+.\n\n### Currently supports:\n\n -

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-06-08T12:24:31.708544Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1644261,"followers":2804,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.8.8","1.8.9"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"374z4jcq","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.2-1.20 - Forge","version_number":"1.6.2-1.20","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Update to 1.20\r\n* Fix Ukrainian localization by @BurrConnie in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/104\r\n* Italian Translation by @TheBossMagnus in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/108\r\n* gradle: Fix executable bit by @5HT2 in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/112\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @BurrConnie made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/104\r\n* @TheBossMagnus made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/108\r\n* @5HT2 made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/112\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.2-1.19.4...1.6.2-1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-08T12:24:30.292495Z","downloads":43897,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"c958a821ba34e6550afd12eb95571585270ec038","sha512":"00c03643642a811d72d48a6a370efbe220753b3836ea4c040ee56495cc1566e75ca1c5cc9f834f99733757dc56eaed3c90fb4b0092adfa992314f1cc816a5919"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/374z4jcq/entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.jar","filename":"entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":60489,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entityculling-forge-1.6.2-mc1.20.jar"},"mods\\oculus-mc1.20-1.6.4.jard":{"sha512":"3afca1b461248f2b87fe9fc534660488e5bd7dc9d24d1e2d1a46eabdb28c5dcbae9906d4392ee678f7c6f6e4dcb2b694a6ea7765b57e0a3abd4122674a5152cd","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"GchcoXML","slug":"oculus","project_type":"mod","team":"zFcUWaYx","title":"Oculus","description":"Unofficial Fork of \"Iris\", made to work with FML","body":"Unofficial Fork of \"Iris\", made to work with FML\n\nFeatures\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Features</summary>\n\n- Performance.

and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it.

However, given the scope of changes\nit makes to the renderer, it may have compatibility issues with some mods that use advanced rendering. Please open an\nissue if you experience problems. Some issues may require changes to be made in the other mod but it's good to have\nthem documented.\n\nThe [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/wiki/Compatibility#known-incompatibilities) has a somewhat-maintained list of known incompatibilities.\n\n**OptiFine is not supported** for obvious reasons.\n\n## Shaders\n\nFor now, please continue to use [Oculus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus) if you want shader support.\nNote that Oculus is somewhat buggy, and your experience will probably be more stable without it. I recommend removing\nOculus if you do not need shaders.\n\n## Credits\n\n* JellySquid & the CaffeineMC team, for making Sodium in the first place, without which this project would not be possible\n* Asek3, for the initial port to Forge\n* XFactHD, for providing a list of gamebreaking Rubidium issues to start this work off, and for testing early builds\n* Pepper, for their invaluable assistance with getting Forge lighting to work on Sodium 0.5\n\n## License\n\nPlease refer to the [LICENSE](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/blob/16.x/forge/LICENSE) file.

The menu also lets you toggle the visibility of disabled waypoints, toggle rendering all sets and change the current waypoint set.

In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, there is no official way to do that. Copying cache from a singleplayer map will not work.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page.

It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen. You can even shift it by 1 pixel if you so wish. Can be useful when playing with other UI mods.</li>\n<li>2 block color modes:&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Vanilla</strong>, which uses the colors of vanilla Minecraft maps and&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Accurate</strong>, which uses the colors of block textures and biomes. You can also enable biome colors for the Vanilla mode using a separate setting.</li>\n<li>A custom key binding (Z by default) to temporarily enlarge the minimap to take a better look around.&nbsp;<strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.&nbsp;</strong>There are also settings for controlling the behavior of the minimap when it is enlarged, for example to center the minimap on the screen or to fully zoom out the minimap.</li>\n<li>Map shading customization with the \"Terrain Depth\" and \"Terrain Slopes\" settings.</li>\n<li>Compatible with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's World Map</a>. By default uses the map textures generated by the world map mod instead of generating its own. This improves performance when using both mods.</li>\n<li>Option to limit your minimap access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets. Your current set can be quickly switched with a key binding. <strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sharing</strong>. You can share your waypoints in the game chat with players on the server. This is done from the waypoints list (press U).</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Deathpoints</strong>.

The chunks where slimes can spawn are marked with a green overlay.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom light overlay</strong>. You can setup a light overlay that will mark blocks with a custom color if they are within a custom light value range, which is block light from 0 to 7 by default. The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\".

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.
